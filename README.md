LPR (License Plate Recognition) is an image-processing technology used to identify vehicles by their license plates. This technology is used in various security and traffic applications, such as the access-control system featured in the following animation:

The OpenALPR CarCheck API is a hosted ALPR web service for application integration. Send images to the OpenALPR cloud servers and the response will be a JSON document describing the license plates, and vehicle variables such as color, make, and body type.
